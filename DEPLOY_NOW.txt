========================================
   🚀 DEPLOY YOUR WEBSITE NOW!
========================================

Follow these steps to make your website
accessible from anywhere in 5 MINUTES!

========================================
   EASIEST METHOD: NETLIFY
========================================

STEP 1: Go to Netlify
   Open browser and visit:
   👉 https://app.netlify.com/signup
   
STEP 2: Sign Up (30 seconds)
   • Click "Sign up"
   • Use Email, GitHub, or Google
   • Verify your email
   
STEP 3: Deploy Site (2 minutes)
   • Click "Add new site"
   • Click "Deploy manually"
   • Drag your "Data Storage" folder
   • Wait 30 seconds
   • DONE!

STEP 4: Get Your URL
   You'll get a URL like:
   https://random-name-123.netlify.app
   
STEP 5: Share Links
   Registration:
   https://your-site.netlify.app/player_registration.html
   
   Gallery:
   https://your-site.netlify.app/players_gallery.html

========================================
   THAT'S IT! YOU'RE LIVE! 🎉
========================================

Your folder to upload:
📁 /Users/akash13.tiwari/Documents/Data Storage/

Contains:
   ✅ player_registration.html
   ✅ players_gallery.html
   ✅ All other files

========================================
   ⚠️ IMPORTANT TO KNOW
========================================

Current Setup Uses localStorage:
   • Each person's browser stores their own data
   • Data is NOT shared across devices
   • Everyone sees only their own registration

This means:
   ❌ John registers → Only John sees himself
   ❌ Mary registers → Only Mary sees herself
   ❌ They don't see each other

========================================
   💡 TWO WAYS TO USE IT
========================================

OPTION A: Single Gallery Display
   ✅ Host on Netlify (done above)
   ✅ Share registration link to everyone
   ✅ Use ONE device (tablet/TV) for gallery
   ✅ Everyone registers on their phones
   ✅ Gallery device shows all locally

OPTION B: Shared Database (Upgrade)
   ✅ Add Firebase (free)
   ✅ Everyone sees same data
   ✅ Real-time sync
   ✅ Takes 15-30 minutes to set up
